## ElementWing - A DIY Command Wing for ETC EOS
This project is an extension of [my previous](https://github.com/jamiejcole/zenith) EOS controller that I made primarily for controlling moving fixtures, as my Element 2 console doesn't have any encoder wheels.

It's a full sized EOS command wing, featuring the standard ETC key layout and 4 customisable rotary encoders.
